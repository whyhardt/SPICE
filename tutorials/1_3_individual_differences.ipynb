    "# Tutorial 4 - Tackling Individual Differences with Participant Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "By talking about individual differences, cognitive scientists are referring to individual notions in exhibited behavior, e.g. different learning rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simplified case, we are going to collect data from two participants with two individual learning rates. Then, we try to recover them once with the last RNN (learning rate with hardcoded equations for the reward prediction error, precoded) and a version which implements a participant-embedding layer. As usual, we first use the precoded model and then show how to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "But this thought can go even deeper if we not only consider different parameterizations for each participant but also different model architectures for each participant!\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of the following scenario: \n",
    "\n",
    "One participant exhibits only goal-directed behavior (i.e. making choices based only on the reward-based values) while another participant shows an additional positivity bias (i.e. increasing the learning rate for positive outcomes while the value is low and a decreasing the learning rate for negative outcomes while the value is high). Such a positivity bias can help to account for reward volatility, by preventing to drastic value updates in the case of an unexpected penalty ($reward = 0$). Additionally, it can also induce goal-directed exploration by making more drastic updates in the case of an unexpected reward.  -->\n",

    "# Handling empirical data\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to handling empirical data from experiments, observed behavior becomes much more complex and noisier at the same time, we are oftentimes handling only one session per participant, and the individual differences can be much stronger. All these circumstances make model fitting very difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this context four measures proved to be very helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regularization via dropout: You can add the kwarg `dropout=0.5` to `setup_embedding` to increase generalizability\n",
    "2. Regulization via l2-weight-decay: We trained here per default with `l2_weight_decay=1e-4`. We could increase this parameter in order to penalize the RNN for overfitting on noisy or too complex behavior. That way we are making sure that the fitted cognitive dynamics are recoverable by the default polynomial library.\n",
    "3. Use a learning rate scheduler: You can activate a cyclic learning rate scheduler with warm restarts by passing the kwarg `scheduler=True` to `SpiceEstimaror`. LR scheduler proved to be helpful when it comes to fitting very subtle individual differences by decreasing the learning rate gradually. In order to not get stuck in local minima, the warm restarts are increasing the lr back to its default value.\n",
    "4. When using a learning rate scheduler you have to make sure to increase the number of epochs. Until now we trained all models with 2^10=1024 epochs. For real data it basically cannot get enough. But 2^13=8192 epochs proved to be sufficient to get good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep all these steps in mind when handling empirical data and you are good to go and apply SPICE to your very own project!"
