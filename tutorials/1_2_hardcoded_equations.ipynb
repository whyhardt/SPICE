    "# Tutorial 3 - SPICE modules as hardcoded equations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to add hardcoded equations as SPICE modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, the equation for `x_reward_value_chosen` resembled the reward-prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward-prediction error is fairly well understood in cognitive science - also thanks to neuroimaging studies, which underlie the assumption about the classic mathematical form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the possible novel findings are quite limited here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning rate on the other hand is in many studies assumed to be a constant and is also embedded in the SPICE-discovered equation as a fixed parameter. \n",
    "It can of course model asymmetric learning rates for rewards and penalties but is not adapting dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what if we would like to find a dynamical equation which describes how the learning rate could possibly change with respect to rewards or the current value `x_reward_value_chosen`? \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that we cannot just add another RNN-module in-line with `x_reward_value_chosen` which processes the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would result in two modules which would not have unique solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have to disentangle here by adding knowledge about `x_reward_value_chosen` in the form of the classic reward-prediction error.\n",
    "\n",
    "That way we are ending up with an additional RNN-module in the form of a hard-coded equation, and we have to expand the memory state by one variable which is the learning rate `x_learning_rate_reward`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we are going to set the initial values for all memory state variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section you will learn how to add hard-coded equations to the RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual, we first start with the precoded model and then show how to implement it."
