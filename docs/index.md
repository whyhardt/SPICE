# SPICE Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for SPICE (Sparse and Interpretable Cognitive Equations), a framework for automating scientific practice in cognitive science.

## Overview

SPICE is built on two fundamental principles:

1. **Task-specific RNN Training**: A neural network is trained to predict human behavior and implicitly learn latent cognitive mechanisms.

2. **Equation Discovery**: Using Sparse Identification of nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to derive interpretable mathematical equations from the learned mechanisms.

## Quick Links

- [Installation Guide](installation.html)
- [Quick Start Tutorial](quickstart.html)
- [API Reference](api.html)
- [Tutorials](tutorials.html)

## Key Features

- Scikit-learn compatible estimator interface
- Customizable network architecture for identifying complex cognitive mechanisms
- Participant embeddings for identifying individual differences
- Precoded models for:
  - Simple Rescorla-Wagner
  - Forgetting mechanism
  - Choice perseveration
  - Participant embeddings
