## Running the Tutorials

Each tutorial is available in two formats:
1. As an interactive Jupyter notebook in the `tutorials/` directory of the repository
2. As a web page in this documentation

To run the interactive notebooks:

1. Clone the SPICE repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whyhardt/SPICE.git
   cd SPICE
   ```

2. Install SPICE and its dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook tutorials/
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts
- Basic knowledge of cognitive modeling principles
